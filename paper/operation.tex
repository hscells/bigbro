\section{Operation of the System}

% What does your demonstration do and how does it work? What does it look like?

Big Brother has two main components: a high-throughput server and a JavaScript client. The client listens to events that occur in a web browser, and the server ingests them in real-time.
\vspace{-8pt}
\subsection{Client}

The Big Brother client has been written to provide maximum functionality with minimal setup and configuration. The smallest amount of code to have Big Brother listen to events is presented in Listing~\ref{lst:minimal}. By default, Big Brother is configured to listen to all events on all elements on a page. This client has been put to the test on multiple user studies with highly complex interfaces~\cite{cross2021search,jimmy2019health,jimmy2020health}. Practitioners of these studies and users of their systems noticed no slowdown of their study as a result of using Big Brother.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, label=lst:minimal, caption=Minimal example of code required to initialise \bb on the client-side. Note the \texttt{session\_id} which should already be initialied elsewhere.]
<script src="bigbro.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
BigBro.init(session_id, "localhost:1984");
</script>
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Often, however, the practitioner of a user study may only be interested in a subset of events. Listing~\ref{lst:events} presents the JavaScript code required on the client-side to restrict Big Brother to listen to two events: \texttt{mousemove} and \texttt{onload}, which will record the coordinates of the users' mouse, and the time the session began respectively.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, label=lst:events, caption=Initialising \bb to listen on only certain global events. HTML code removed for brevity.]
BigBro.init(session_id, 
            "localhost:1984", 
            ["mousemove", "onload"]);
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Sometimes, the practitioner of a user study may wish to capture custom interactions or events from their user. For example, logging a custom event for when a user clicks a specific button on the page. Listing~\ref{lst:custom} presents the JavaScript code required on the client-side to wire the processing of a custom event to Big Brother's exposed custom logging functionality.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, label=lst:custom, caption=Wiring up \bb to listen to click events and to log a custom event.]
let bb = BigBro.init(session_id, 
                     "localhost:1984");
let w = window;
w.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    bb.log(e, "custom_event");
})
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Finally, it is possible to record the screen using Big Brother. Listing~\ref{lst:capture} presents the minimum JavaScript code required to start a live capture of the browser window a user is looking at. Because of browser security, screen capture cannot be started automatically, and must be initiated by clicking an element (as seen in the argument provided to the function in Listing~\ref{lst:capture}). Captures are saved as a series of images. The time between each capture can be configured, and captures can be taken in response to events. The images can be stitched together into a video later, or can be used to highlight specific interactions from the logs. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, label=lst:capture, caption=Wiring up \bb to listen to click events and to log a custom event.]
let bb = BigBro.init(session_id, 
                     "localhost:1984");
bb.startCaptureOnClick("capture");
\end{lstlisting}


The Big Brother client has been specifically designed to require very minimal configuration and setup. Likewise, the server is designed to be run independently of components such as the web server a user study is hosted on.


\subsection{Server}

The server is written in the Go programming language. This provides a number of advantages, primarily the ability for the server code to be compiled into a high-performance single-binary file for multiple platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.). The server can be configured using command-line options. It can also be integrated into existing web servers as library code, so long as those servers are written in Go.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{0.2\linewidth}p{0.7\linewidth}}
\hline
Component & Description of Component \\
\hline
Target & The HTML element that has caused the event to trigger. \\
Name & The \texttt{name} attribute of the HTML element in Target. \\
ID & The \texttt{id} attribute of the HTML element in Target\\
Method & The name of the method that caused the event to trigger. \\
Location & The web-page location on the server (URL, with query string and anchors). \\
Comment & Any additional custom information that may be useful to interpreting the event. \\
X & The x-position within the web browser that the event occurred at. \\
Y & The y-position within the web browser that the event occurred at. \\
ScreenWidth & The width of the web browser the event occurred within. \\
ScreenHeight & The height of the web browser the event occurred within. \\
Time & The time the event happened.\\
Actor & An identifier that can be used to refer to the user that caused the event, e.g., session ID. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The components of an event.\vspace{-16pt}}
\label{tbl:event}
\end{table}

The server processes interactions from users as \textit{events}. The components that comprise an event are summarised in Table~\ref{tbl:event}.
An event captures information about the HTML elements that were interacted with (\textbf{Target}, \textbf{Name}, \textbf{ID}), how the event was triggered (\textbf{Method}), what the URL was on the page that the event occurred (\textbf{Location}), additional custom comments (\textbf{Comment}), positional information to "replay" interactions (\textbf{X}, \textbf{Y}, \textbf{ScreenWidth}, \textbf{ScreenHeight}), the time that the event occurred (\textbf{Time}), and the user that caused the event (\textbf{Actor}).

Events are streamed from the user's web browser to a centralised server over websockets. This enables the real-time ingestion of interactions. Currently, Big Brother can output logs to a local csv file as well as directly indexing them to Elasticsearch. A small, real example of logs captured during a user study is presented in Listing~\ref{lst:logs}. The researcher who ran this study decided to output their interaction logs directly to a csv file. The ordering of components in these events is how they are produced by \bb. Listing~\ref{lst:components} shows the ordering of components in the csv file output. These logs show the interactions of two user sessions from a human intelligence task (HIT) on a popular crowdsourcing platform. This slice of interaction logs begins when the \texttt{A1} user starts a HIT, and ends when they finish the HIT. At the same time, another user (\texttt{A2}) is in the middle of another HIT. The researcher running this user study records when their users click on a multiple select dropdown. The very final line in the log, when user \texttt{A1} finishes the HIT, also logs the recorded answers to the questionnaire using the Comment component: \texttt{T|T|T|T|T}.

In addition to allowing the researcher to see in real-time how users are interacting with their experiments (and potentially throw away sessions from users who completed the study too quickly), it provides a second way to record responses that users make to questionnaires.

\subsection{Throughput Benchmark}

We demonstrate the ability of Big Brother to scale and accommodate very large user studies by providing a throughput benchmark of logging user interactions directly to a csv file. To make the benchmark more realistic, we simulate the time it takes to process an event by encoding and decoding the event, and populate the event with random data. Each event has Target, Method, Location, X, Y, ScreenHeight, ScreenWidth, Time and Actor components. To benchmark the code, we use the standard benchmarking framework included in the Go language (as this is the language that the server is written in). In this framework, a loop containing the process described earlier is run $N$ times until it takes a second for the benchmark to complete. We report the total number of events processed, the average time it takes to process one event in microseconds, and the throughput in MB/s. We run the benchmark ten times and report both each run and the overall statistics. The benchmarks were run on a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 8-core 2018 MacBook Pro with 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM and solid-state flash storage. Table~\ref{tbl:bench} presents the results of the benchmark. On average, Big Brother can process approximately 70,000 events per second, with each event processed in approximately 26$\mu$s, and write the interactions to a file at a speed of approximately 5MB/s. In our studies, while we never came close to this amount of interactions per second, \bb did remain resilient and experienced no faults over the course of a number of studies.

\subsection{Other Tools within Big Brother}

The Big Brother family also includes other tools for visualising and manipulating data produced by the \bb tool. These include \bbheat and \bbstat, which are compatible with CSV formatted logs produced by \bb. If Elasticsearch is used as the storage medium for logs, it is possible to use the infrastructure that has been developed for it, including Kibana. Note that it is possible to use the Big Brother tools and the Elasticsearch tools by allowing \bb to write to a CSV file and ingesting that file into Elasticsearch using software such as Logstash. For details on how to use these tools, please refer to the GitHub repository.

\vspace{-8pt}
\subsection{\texttt{bbheat}}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{heatmap}
	\caption{Heat map of mouse interactions overlaid on top of an image of a search interface captured using the screen recording functionality of Big Brother.\vspace{-16pt}}
	\label{fig:heat}
\end{figure}

Often it useful to be able to visualise the interactions of users over user interfaces. For this, the \bbheat tool can be used. This tool allows one to produce a static or animated heat map of mouse movements. The tool has several options for filtering interactions, for example by actor, time, and browser window size. An example of one of the heat maps produced by this tool is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:heat}. Using the screen recording functionality of Big Brother, it becomes trivial to visualise how different users interact with a system, or how changes in interface design can impact user behaviour.

\vspace{-8pt}
\subsection{\texttt{bbstat}}

Analysing log data can be tedious, especially processing the data for analysis. The \bbstat tool provides common functionality for processing interaction logs for later analysis. The functionality provided by the \bbstat tool include filtering: interaction logs can be split into multiple files based on actor, time, or comment, and aggregation: production of reports such as how long a user spent on different pages or how many times certain elements in a page were clicked.

\vspace{-8pt}
\subsection{Kibana}

Kibana is a product that is developed by the same company that built Elasticsearch. It provides tools for visualising and manipulating data. Kibana has been developed with time series logs in mind. A deeper description of Kibana is not provided here for space reasons, but it can be a powerful alternative to the tools provided by Big Brother.
