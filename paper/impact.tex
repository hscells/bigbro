\section{Impact of Big Brother}

The Big Brother logging system has been used already in several user studies and has been `battle tested'. We demonstrate the ability of the \bb server to scale to tens of thousands of interactions per second. We have developed the Big Brother ecosystem to allow researchers to integrate interaction logging into any web-based system. Furthermore, we have designed the entire system to be extremely easy to use, while providing highly sophisticated functionality, such as screen recording. These attributes, we believe, will significantly lower the barrier to entry for capturing user interactions in many research settings.
